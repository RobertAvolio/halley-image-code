# halley-image-code
Code for translating the fortran halley code file to an updated software.

Code of the original ap_photo_Halley file, written by Nalin Samarasinha, was updated by Robert Avolio with the help of Roy Prouty.
Last updated January 2023.

To run this program, use `python3 ap_photo_Halley.py testfile.txt`, where testfile.txt is the input file.
Input files can be generated in /testfiles/ by running `python3 randomSamples.py`.
